# Arduino General-Purpose Template  

 To avoid the trouble that inlcude path has to be configured everytime a new assignment is created, I made this template that reflects only my computer's file structure, especially location of Arduino app.  
 This template contains mainly just appropriate configuration files that might help during the course Physics 4AL, UCLA W2020, in the way that they enable intellisense within VSCode. Install Arduino first before any of the json files can work!  

## Note

 These files are created in Windows 10, so they use CRLF endings.  

## TODO

### Create a react app that enable most of the operations for this app

### Figure out how to start the app with a webpage
